# Vuza Finance

Vuza Finance is bringing TradFi borrow rates into DeFi and solving offchain collateral risks that have challenged flow of liquidity supply from Web3 into TradFi.

Vuza enables offchain lending by connecting Investment DAOs, DeFi LPS & Institutional Staking Platforms with on-lending financial institutions in emerging markets, such as Credit Unions, Banks, MFIs & Real Estate Investors.

The aim is to enable affordable lending to thriving businesses (via on-lenders) in emerging markets while innovating an onchain loan guarantor model for Web3 lenders in a trust minimized and efficient manner.

We settle the loans in usable legal tender + abstract away Web3 complexities for the TradFi borrower. 

The platform sources funds Web3 lenders at competitive rates and converts them to fiat eg. USD/EUR. These funds are then onlent to Credit Unions, MFIs, and other financial institutions, which can use them to offer loans to their SMEs. The platform facilitates the conversion of repayments back to the original tokens, enabling the return of the principal and interest to the lenders.

Vuza is innovating a guarantor model through yield fixing markets (see "How it Works" board below for architecture)
